# Caldo Skills

## Install

Install with the [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills), which works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex and other agents:

```
npx skills add caldoai/skills
```

To install a single skill:

```
npx skills add caldoai/skills --skill untangle-codebase
```

Or, in Claude Code, add this repo as a plugin marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add caldoai/skills
```

Then install a skill with the command in its row of the table below.

To install by hand instead, copy a skill's folder into `~/.claude/skills/`.

## Skills

| Skill | Description | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [untangle-codebase](skills/untangle-codebase/SKILL.md) | Untangle a codebase for agents. | `/plugin install untangle-codebase@caldo-skills` |

## Adding a skill

1. Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
2. Add an entry for it to `plugins` in [.claude-plugin/marketplace.json](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json).
3. Add a row to the table above.
