# Routing detail - developer-platform-skills collection

Route only from the declared scopes below. Every "do not route here" line comes from the skill's own description, not from inference. The kickoff's own routing table states what each skill covers; this file states where each one _stops_, which is what a two-way keyword collision actually needs.

Nothing here is ranked, and nothing in it should be. Scope is a match test, not a ratio. Ranking lives in the kickoff's short-list and routine set, where several skills compete for one session (see `samber/developer-platform-skills@developer-platform-kickoff` § 4 and § 7).

Nine skills sit at macro altitude:

- `api-integration-surface-strategy`
- `api-versioning-policy`
- `public-roadmap-strategy`
- `sdk-portfolio-strategy`
- `developer-portal-design`
- `sample-app-strategy`
- `etl-connector-strategy`
- `integration-partnership-strategy`
- `connector-marketplace-strategy`

Each shares subject keywords with a tactical sibling and is separated from it by altitude, not by topic.

Three further pairs split by _side of the table_, where the keywords are identical and the advice inverts:

- Operator vs submitter.
- Issuer vs consumer.
- Provider vs client.

Both kinds are collected under Boundary pairs below.

## Per-skill signals

### `samber/developer-platform-skills@api-integration-surface-strategy`

- Route here: "which API should we build first", "should we add GraphQL or MCP", "a deal is blocked on a surface we don't have", API-first vs embedded-first sequencing.
- Do not route here: designing any chosen surface - it hands off to the per-surface sibling once the surface is picked.

### `samber/developer-platform-skills@public-api-design-review`

- Route here:
  - Audit a REST surface against design rules, bucketing findings Must-change or Improvement.
  - Stand up the review program (lifecycle triggers, reviewer authority, linting, federation).
  - "Review this API before we publish it."
- Do not route here: generating a spec or server code; error taxonomy, versioning, idempotency, auth, rate limits and docs depth each belong to a named sibling.

### `samber/developer-platform-skills@api-error-design`

- Route here: "our errors just say 400", designing the code taxonomy and the RFC 9457 envelope, making messages actionable, signalling retryability.
- Do not route here: client-side retry mechanics, whole-surface consistency review, incident or status-page communication.

### `samber/developer-platform-skills@api-idempotency-retry`

- Route here: "make POST safe to retry", "customers are double-charged", adding an `Idempotency-Key` header, writing retry guidance, setting SDK backoff defaults.
- Do not route here: what the error response signals (`api-error-design`); webhook delivery retries (`webhook-platform-design`).

- Do not route here: the admission security review (`app-marketplace-review`); where a badge renders on a listing (`app-marketplace-listing-standards`); a vendor earning a badge on someone else's catalog (`etl-connector-strategy`, `integration-listing-optimization`); certifying people (`samber/developer-relations-skills@developer-certification-program`).

### `samber/developer-platform-skills@app-marketplace-listing-standards`

- Route here: defining what every listing must contain, screenshot and media requirements, the description quality bar, category taxonomy design, rejection criteria, when stale listings get downgraded or delisted.
- Do not route here: optimizing your own listing on someone else's marketplace; the security review behind admission.

### `samber/developer-platform-skills@app-marketplace-monetization-model`

- Route here: merchant-of-record posture, billing rails, the fee stack and its anti-circumvention rule, fee waivers, payout cadence and hold windows, the facilitator/VAT tax layer.
- Do not route here: the take-rate _level_ and tier structure (`connector-marketplace-strategy`); this skill designs the collection mechanics under whatever level that skill set.

### `samber/developer-platform-skills@app-marketplace-launch-marketing`

- Route here: launching a marketplace, sizing the founding cohort, coordinating the reveal and partner embargoes, featured-app and spotlight rotations, allocating MDF and per-partner co-marketing budget.
- Do not route here: a vendor optimizing its own listing on someone else's marketplace.

### `samber/developer-platform-skills@github-engagement-playbook`

- Route here: "our GitHub stars are flat", whether and how to run Discussions on an SDK repository, getting releases noticed by watchers, which topics to set, a label scheme for issues, PRs and discussions, keeping the repository visibly active in the feed, archiving traffic and tracking mentions, PR and tracking-issue templates, a board deck that reports stars, a request to buy, trade or reward stars.
- Do not route here: the launch itself (`samber/developer-relations-skills@oss-launch`), README text and sidebar copy (`samber/developer-relations-skills@readme-optimization`), a profile page (`samber/developer-relations-skills@github-profile-optimization`), the cross-channel distribution mix (`samber/developer-relations-skills@oss-distribution-strategy`), publishing the package behind a release (`sdk-package-publishing`), choosing a license (`samber/developer-relations-skills@oss-license-strategy`).

### `samber/developer-platform-skills@stackoverflow-playbook`

- Route here: "our Stack Overflow tag is full of unanswered questions", staff or engineers answering on Stack Overflow, answers flagged as spam or self-promotion, the tag excerpt and wiki, ChatGPT-drafted answers, whether Stack Overflow is still worth the hours.
- Do not route here: the error pages on your own docs (`samber/developer-relations-skills@developer-troubleshooting-docs`), getting your own docs cited by AI assistants (`samber/developer-relations-skills@developer-docs-ai-visibility`), measuring several community channels together (`samber/developer-relations-skills@developer-community-health`), an internal Stack Internal (Teams) instance.

### `samber/developer-platform-skills@huggingface-playbook`

- Route here: releasing the company's own models, datasets or demo Spaces on the Hugging Face Hub; one repo or many for sizes and quantizations; model or dataset card metadata; whether to gate a model and what gating collects; custom licenses and the EU AI Act duties of an open-weights release; which plan a demo Space needs, ZeroGPU quota lockouts; a missing inference widget; trending, likes and the Community tab; what Hub download counts mean for a board report.
- Do not route here: publishing the Python or JS library that loads the weights (`sdk-package-publishing`), the sample and demo portfolio as a whole (`sample-app-strategy`), choosing, evaluating or deploying someone else's Hub model, training or fine-tuning code, the cross-channel launch (`samber/developer-relations-skills@oss-launch`), the license of the accompanying code (`samber/developer-relations-skills@oss-license-strategy`).

### `samber/developer-platform-skills@developer-platform-career`

- Route here: breaking into an API Product Manager, Platform Engineer/Architect, or Partner/Integration Engineer role, prepping a platform-engineering or API-PM interview, evaluating an offer against this track's own ladder and comp benchmark.
- Do not route here: hiring for these roles (`developer-platform-hiring`), or a developer advocate, community manager, developer educator, or DevRel-flavored DX engineer target - `samber/developer-relations-skills@devrel-career`.

### `samber/developer-platform-skills@developer-platform-hiring`

- Route here: writing a posting, building a scorecard or interview loop, sourcing candidates, or setting a compensation stance for an API Product Manager, Platform Engineer/Architect, or Partner/Integration Engineer role.
- Do not route here: candidate-side prep (`developer-platform-career`), or hiring a developer advocate, community manager, developer educator, or DevRel-flavored DX engineer - `samber/developer-relations-skills@devrel-hiring`.

### `samber/developer-platform-skills@developer-platform-kickoff`

- Route here: project start, periodic check-in, "which skill do I need", re-routing mid-project. This skill routes; it never performs a sibling's job itself.

## Boundary pairs

Where two or more siblings collide on keywords, decide from these declared-scope boundaries.

**Split by altitude.** The kickoff's altitude rule names each macro/tactical pair; these are the questions that decide them at the boundary:

- **api-integration-surface-strategy vs every per-surface skill** - "Should we add GraphQL?" → strategy. "Design our GraphQL schema" → the surface skill. A surface question arriving with no audience attached is always the strategy question in disguise.
- **api-versioning-policy vs public-api-design-review** - "What are we allowed to change?" → policy. "Is this surface well-designed?" → review. A review that finds no agreed breaking-change definition escalates up to the policy.
- **sdk-portfolio-strategy vs api-idempotency-retry** - "Which SDKs first?" → portfolio. "What should the SDK do on a 503?" → idempotency-retry.
- **cli-interface-design vs mcp-server-offering** - "What commands, flags and `--json` contract does our CLI expose?" → CLI. "Which tools does our MCP server expose?" → MCP. Both may serve agents; which surface to build first is `api-integration-surface-strategy`.
- **cli-interface-design vs sdk-package-publishing** - "What does the CLI do and promise?" → CLI design. "How do we ship its binaries and packages?" → publishing.
- **github-action-offering vs cli-interface-design / sdk-package-publishing** - "What does our action take, output and promise, and how do we tag and secure it?" → action. "What do the CLI's commands and exit codes promise?" → CLI. "How do we publish the CLI binary to registries and Homebrew?" → publishing. A new action usually needs all three, in that reverse order: CLI contract, then binaries, then the action.
- **ide-extension-offering vs cli-interface-design / mcp-server-offering** - "Should we ship a VS Code or JetBrains extension, and how do we publish, measure and retire it?" → extension. "What does the CLI the extension wraps promise?" → CLI. "Which tools do agents in the editor call?" → MCP; the extension may only distribute that server. A new extension usually needs the CLI contract first.
- **agent-integration-surfaces vs api-integration-surface-strategy / mcp-server-offering** - "Should we add MCP or a CLI next to REST and SDKs?" → surface strategy. "Which agents get in where, how do they authenticate and act for users, sign up, and get counted?" → agent integration surfaces, which picks the execution path per agent class and hands each surface's design to its skill. "Which tools does the MCP server expose?" → MCP.
- **agent-skill-offering vs mcp-server-offering / cli-interface-design** - "Ship instructions that teach agents to drive our CLI or SDK, versioned with it" → agent skill. "Expose our product as remote tools an agent without a shell can call" → MCP. "Design the CLI's commands and `--json` contract" → CLI design. The skill's step 1 hands the other two over.
- **terraform-provider-offering vs sdk-package-publishing / api-integration-surface-strategy** - "Should we have an IaC surface at all, next to SDKs and a CLI?" → surface strategy. "Design, sign and publish our Terraform/OpenTofu provider" → provider offering. "Ship our Go SDK or CLI binary to a registry" → publishing; the provider's own GoReleaser and Registry flow stays with the provider skill.
- **sdk-portfolio-strategy vs sdk-package-publishing** - "Which SDKs should exist and at what tier?" → portfolio. "How do we ship them to npm and PyPI without long-lived tokens?" → publishing.
- **sdk-package-publishing vs github-engagement-playbook** - "How does the package reach the registry?" → publishing. "How does the GitHub Release reach watchers, and what do we post in Discussions?" → playbook. One release usually needs both, publishing first.
- **huggingface-playbook vs sdk-package-publishing** - "How do the weights, card and demo reach the Hub?" → playbook. "How does the library that loads them reach PyPI or npm?" → publishing. A model release with its own loading library needs both, library first so the card snippet runs.
- **stackoverflow-playbook vs api-error-design** - "What does the error response say?" → error design. "Where does the fix live when a developer pastes that error into a search engine?" → the playbook's canonical Q&A, mirrored by `samber/developer-relations-skills@developer-troubleshooting-docs` on your own docs.
- **sample-app-strategy vs sdk-portfolio-strategy / api-test-mode-design** - "Which sample repos do we keep, and in which languages?" → samples. "Which SDK languages exist?" → SDK portfolio. "What do the samples run against?" → test mode. SDK tiers feed sample coverage; never the reverse.
- **developer-portal-design vs api-auth-key-management / api-test-mode-design / integration-error-observability / api-reference-quality** - "Where does the key dashboard live and what else belongs on that page?" → portal. "What does a key look like and how does rotation work?" → key management. The portal decides which self-service surfaces exist and where; each sibling designs one of them.
- **connector-marketplace-strategy vs the four app-marketplace skills** - "Should we build one?" and "what take-rate?" → strategy. "How do we collect it?" → monetization-model. "What must a listing contain?" → listing-standards. "What gets rejected?" → review. "How do we launch it?" → launch-marketing.
- **integration-partnership-strategy vs partner-app-onboarding / etl-connector-strategy / integration-listing-optimization** - "Which partners matter?" → strategy. "How does a partner get from signup to first app?" → onboarding. "How do we get listed on their ETL catalog?" → etl-connector-strategy. "Why is our listing not converting?" → listing-optimization.

- **zapier-integration-playbook vs integration-listing-optimization / webhook-platform-design** - one platform's mechanics vs the generic method. "How do we build, review, launch and version our Zapier app?" → the playbook. "Why does our listing not convert across marketplaces?" → listing-optimization. "How does our API let anyone subscribe to events?" → webhook-platform-design, which the playbook's REST hook triggers then call.
- **salesforce-appexchange-playbook vs integration-listing-optimization / app-marketplace-review** - one marketplace's admission and money path vs the generic listing method vs the operator's chair. "How do we pass Salesforce's security review, package and get paid?" → the playbook. "Why does our AppExchange listing not convert or rank?" → listing-optimization. "How should our own marketplace review third-party apps?" → app-marketplace-review.
- **google-workspace-marketplace-playbook vs oauth2-provider-design / integration-listing-optimization** - the client's chair in Google's verification vs the issuer's chair for your own API vs the generic listing method. "Which Gmail scopes avoid CASA, and why was our Workspace listing rejected?" → the playbook. "How should our API's own consent and app verification work?" → oauth2-provider-design. "Why does our Workspace listing not convert?" → listing-optimization.
- **slack-app-directory-playbook vs integration-listing-optimization / app-marketplace-review / oauth2-provider-design** - one marketplace's admission rules vs the generic listing method vs the operator's chair vs the issuer's chair. "Why did Slack return our app and which scopes will pass?" → the playbook. "Why does our Slack listing not convert?" → listing-optimization. "How should our own marketplace review apps?" → app-marketplace-review. "How should our API's scopes be designed?" → oauth2-provider-design.
- **atlassian-marketplace-playbook vs integration-listing-optimization / app-marketplace-monetization-model / integration-partnership-strategy** - one marketplace's admission, payment-model and version rules vs the generic listing method vs the operator's billing design vs the partner-selection decision. "Can our free Jira connector sell a Pro tier through Stripe, and how do we pass review?" → the playbook. "Why does our Atlassian listing not rank?" → listing-optimization. "What take rate should our own marketplace charge?" → monetization-model. "Should we build a Jira integration at all?" → partnership-strategy.
- **github-marketplace-playbook vs github-action-offering / github-engagement-playbook / integration-listing-optimization** - the listing and money path vs the artifact vs the repository vs the generic listing method. "Can we sell our GitHub App on Marketplace, and who can buy it?" → the playbook. "How do we version and harden our action?" → github-action-offering. "Why are our stars flat?" → github-engagement-playbook. "Why does our listing not convert?" → listing-optimization.
- **aws-marketplace-playbook vs integration-listing-optimization / app-marketplace-monetization-model / integration-partnership-strategy** - the seller's transaction and co-sell path vs the generic listing method vs the operator's billing vs the partner choice. "How do we list, send private offers and co-sell with AWS?" → the playbook. "Why does our AWS listing not convert or rank?" → listing-optimization. "How should our own marketplace collect fees?" → monetization-model. "Is AWS the partner to bet on?" → partnership-strategy.
- **microsoft-appsource-playbook vs integration-listing-optimization / integration-partnership-strategy / slack-app-directory-playbook** - one marketplace's admission, money and co-sell path vs the generic listing method vs the partner-selection decision vs the Slack store. "Why did Teams validation return our app, and how do we reach MACC eligibility?" → the playbook. "Why does our Microsoft Marketplace listing not convert?" → listing-optimization. "Should Microsoft be a priority partner at all?" → partnership-strategy. "Our chat app targets Slack" → slack-app-directory-playbook.
- **shopify-app-store-playbook vs integration-listing-optimization / app-marketplace-monetization-model / integration-partnership-strategy** - one marketplace's admission and billing rules vs the generic listing method vs the operator's billing design vs the partner-selection decision. "Can our free connector keep billing through Stripe, and how do we pass Shopify review?" → the playbook. "Why does our Shopify listing not convert?" → listing-optimization. "How should our own marketplace bill apps?" → monetization-model. "Should we build a Shopify integration at all?" → partnership-strategy.
- **hubspot-marketplace-playbook vs integration-listing-optimization / app-marketplace-review / integration-partnership-strategy** - one marketplace's admission, upkeep and partner-tier rules vs the generic listing method vs the operator's chair vs the choice of ecosystem. "Why did HubSpot send our listing back to Draft, and how do we reach three active installs?" → the playbook. "Why does our HubSpot listing not convert?" → listing-optimization. "Should we integrate with HubSpot or Salesforce first?" → integration-partnership-strategy.
- **chrome-web-store-playbook vs ide-extension-offering / integration-listing-optimization / app-marketplace-review** - a browser extension's store admission vs an editor extension as a product vs the generic listing method vs the operator's chair. "Why did Chrome reject our extension and how do we ship the next permission safely?" → the playbook. "Should we ship a VS Code extension and publish it to Open VSX?" → ide-extension-offering. "Why does our Chrome listing not convert?" → listing-optimization. "How should our own marketplace review extensions?" → app-marketplace-review.
- **wordpress-plugin-directory-playbook vs integration-listing-optimization / sdk-package-publishing / app-marketplace-review** - one directory's admission and release rules vs the generic listing method vs registry publishing vs the operator's chair. "Why did WordPress.org pend our plugin and where can the paid features live?" → the playbook. "Why does our listing not convert across marketplaces?" → listing-optimization. "How do we tag and publish our PHP SDK on Packagist?" → sdk-package-publishing. "How should our own marketplace review apps?" → app-marketplace-review.

**Split by side of the table:**

- **integration-listing-optimization vs app-marketplace-listing-standards / app-marketplace-launch-marketing** - same words, opposite chairs. You are the submitter optimizing a listing you own on a marketplace you don't → listing-optimization. You are the operator writing the rules and promoting the catalog → standards and launch-marketing. Ask which side of the review gate the user sits on before routing any "marketplace listing" question.
- **api-auth-key-management vs oauth2-provider-design** - both are credentials you issue, split by whose data the caller acts on. The customer's own backend calling your API on its own behalf → API keys. A third-party app acting on your _users'_ behalf, needing consent → OAuth. Key management owns the decision boundary itself, so an unresolved "keys or OAuth?" starts there.
- **webhook-platform-design vs api-idempotency-retry** - both concern retries, split by direction. You delivering events to a consumer, with your retry schedule and dead-letter policy → webhook-platform-design. A client retrying its call into you, with idempotency keys and backoff → idempotency-retry.

**Split by scope of the audience:**

- **api-error-design vs integration-error-observability vs api-status-communication** - three altitudes of "something failed":
  - One response body an integrator receives → api-error-design. "Our error messages are useless" routes here.
  - One integration's history, aggregated and replayable, visible to the integrator who built it → integration-error-observability. "Partners don't know their integration is broken" routes here.
  - The whole platform's health, visible to everyone at once → api-status-communication. "Customers didn't know we were down" routes here.
- **integration-error-observability vs integration-health-monitoring** - split by tense. An integration failing now, seen in errors, logs and alerts → error-observability. An integration working today that a dated change will break - a sunset, an SDK end of life, a credential expiry → health-monitoring. "Partners don't know their integration is broken" routes to the first; "partners don't know their integration will break on March 31" routes to the second.
- **api-versioning-policy vs integration-health-monitoring** - the policy sets notice windows, headers and enforcement style once; health-monitoring runs that policy integration by integration - census, outreach, brownouts, readiness gate. Pulling a published date earlier is a policy change and goes back to the policy.
- **sql-jdbc-access-design vs bulk-data-sharing-design vs etl-connector-strategy** - three ways to give customers the data, split by who runs the pipe:
  - You expose a live queryable endpoint or share → SQL/JDBC.
  - You deliver files or a lake share on a cadence → bulk sharing.
  - A third-party ETL platform pulls from your API on the customer's behalf → etl-connector-strategy.

  Scan frequency and freshness expectations decide between the first two; who the customer already pays decides the third.

- **public-roadmap-strategy vs api-versioning-policy vs api-status-communication** - three horizons of telling consumers about change:
  - What is coming, and how firmly → public-roadmap-strategy. "Customers keep asking what's next" routes here.
  - What is going away, on what notice → api-versioning-policy. "We need to retire /v1" routes here.
  - What is broken right now → api-status-communication.

- **api-versioning-policy vs api-changelog-automation** - "What counts as breaking, and how much notice?" → policy. "Make CI enforce that definition and write the change record" → automation. An automation request with no written definition escalates to the policy first; the gate may ship meanwhile with a severity map marked provisional.
- **api-reference-quality vs api-changelog-automation** - both put a spec in CI. Is the published reference complete against the spec → reference quality. What changed between two versions of the spec, and did it break callers → automation.

- **api-beta-program vs api-versioning-policy** - the GA line splits them. Before GA, including retiring one preview version for the next and rescuing a beta that never ended → api-beta-program. After GA, including the deprecation window a graduated beta surface gets → api-versioning-policy. A beta program uses the versioning policy's breaking-change definition rather than writing its own.

- **public-graphql-api-design vs graphql-federation-offering** - "Design our public schema" or "split it across our teams" → public-graphql-api-design. "Let partners add their own fields or subgraphs" → graphql-federation-offering. The test is who authors the contributed schema: your own teams, or an outside party.
- **api-rate-limit-policy vs public-graphql-api-design** - GraphQL's depth and complexity ceilings are schema design decisions and live with the schema; the published quota, tier numbers, headers and 429 contract are policy and live with rate-limit-policy. A GraphQL cost model needs both, in that order.
- **partner-app-onboarding vs app-marketplace-review vs api-test-mode-design** - three stages of the same partner's path:
  - Getting to a first submission → onboarding.
  - What happens to that submission → review.
  - How the sandbox they build in is actually isolated → test-mode-design.
- **app-marketplace-review vs connector-certification-program vs app-marketplace-listing-standards** - three questions about the same badge:
  - Is the app safe to admit at all → review.
  - What earns, keeps and loses the certified label → certification program.
  - Where the earned badge shows and how its currency renders → listing standards.

## Ordered chains

Propose a chain only when the task genuinely decomposes this way; never fabricate a sequence. Each chain is listed in dependency order, not efficiency order - a later link consumes what the earlier one produces, so there is no ratio to rank.

- `api-integration-surface-strategy` → the chosen surface skill → `api-versioning-policy` - decide which surface, design it, then commit to what you will and won't break in it. Publish before the promise exists and every later change is negotiated case by case.
- `api-versioning-policy` → `api-changelog-automation` - write the breaking-change definition, then encode it as the severity map the gate enforces. Automating first makes the diff tool's defaults the policy nobody chose.
- `public-api-design-review` → `api-error-design` → `api-idempotency-retry` → `api-reference-quality` - audit, fix the error contract the audit exposed, make failing calls safe to retry, then document. Documenting first just freezes the flaws in prose.
- `api-auth-key-management` → `api-rate-limit-policy` → `integration-error-observability` - you cannot meter or attribute what you cannot identify; the identity issued first is what limits key on and what error rates split by.
- `oauth2-provider-design` → `partner-app-onboarding` → `app-marketplace-review` - apps need delegated auth before a partner journey means anything, and a journey before there are submissions to review.
- `connector-marketplace-strategy` → `app-marketplace-listing-standards` → `app-marketplace-review` → `app-marketplace-monetization-model` → `app-marketplace-launch-marketing` - settle whether and at what curation level, write what a listing must contain, define what gets rejected, wire up collection, then launch. Launching first means grandfathering every early listing.
- `developer-portal-design` → `api-test-mode-design` → `api-reference-quality` - the portal decides which self-service surfaces exist and where; the sandbox and the reference each land in a slot it already reserved.
- `integration-partnership-strategy` → `etl-connector-strategy` or `integration-listing-optimization` - the prioritization decides which platform is worth the connector or listing. Building either first pays a maintenance tax for a platform nobody's customers use.
- `public-api-design-review` → `api-idempotency-retry` → `terraform-provider-offering` - the provider's readiness gate fails on non-idempotent creates and fields never read back; fix the contract before mapping it to resources, or every gap ships as a perpetual diff.
- `webhook-platform-design` → `integration-error-observability` - delivery logs and replay are the debugging surface for the deliveries the first link creates.
- `api-versioning-policy` → `integration-health-monitoring` → `integration-error-observability` - set the notice and enforcement rules, run them per integration until the gate passes, then catch the callers the census missed as errors after cutoff.
- `public-api-design-review` → `api-beta-program` → `api-versioning-policy` - review the new surface at beta level, run the preview that freezes its shape, then put the GA surface under the compatibility promise. Enrolling partners before the review freezes an unreviewed shape.

## Sibling-repo recommendations

`developer-platform-skills` owns the _platform surface_: the API and its lifecycle, the integration surfaces around it, the portal, and the partner and marketplace ecosystem. Two sibling `samber` collections cover adjacent ground this collection intentionally excludes. Recommend installing the sibling instead of stretching a task onto a skill above that doesn't cover it; never frame it as a dependency - this collection stays fully usable standalone.

### `samber/developer-relations-skills` - DevRel practice

Recommend the sibling repo, not a skill above, when the task is:

- Site-wide docs information architecture, rather than endpoint-level reference completeness → `samber/developer-relations-skills@developer-docs-structure-audit`.
- The quickstart page and its first-run narrative → `samber/developer-relations-skills@developer-quickstart-guide`.
- Making an existing SDK, API or protocol consumable by a coding agent unattended → `samber/developer-relations-skills@coding-agent-docs-optimization`. Distinct from `mcp-server-offering`, which builds a _new_ agent-facing tool surface rather than documenting an existing one.
- Whether to evolve from product to platform at all, and how far up the openness ladder → `samber/developer-relations-skills@developer-ecosystem-strategy`. Upstream of `connector-marketplace-strategy`: the ecosystem question is "should we be a platform", the marketplace question is "should we run a catalog".
- The devtools revenue model, or what to open-source → `samber/developer-relations-skills@devtools-business-model`, `samber/developer-relations-skills@oss-distribution-strategy`.
- A launch, relaunch or ongoing presence on Product Hunt - self-hunting, account eligibility, featuring vs points, maker comment, vote-solicitation and AI-comment rules, relaunch gaps → `samber/developer-relations-skills@producthunt-playbook`. Distinct from `app-marketplace-launch-marketing`, which runs a marketplace operator's own launch program.
- A certification or badge that vouches for a developer or partner engineer, rather than for an app → `samber/developer-relations-skills@developer-certification-program`. Distinct from `partner-app-onboarding`, which decides whether education gates a partner's first submission, from `app-marketplace-review`, which admits the app, and from `connector-certification-program`, which certifies partner-built connectors.
- Feature requests scattered across community, support and sales channels, and closing the loop with requesters → `samber/developer-relations-skills@developer-feedback-loop`. Distinct from `public-roadmap-strategy`, which publishes what those decisions add up to.
- A vulnerability report against an open-source SDK, SECURITY.md, CVE and advisory, the disclosure embargo → `samber/developer-relations-skills@oss-security-disclosure`. `sdk-package-publishing` still ships the patched version.
- The release contract of an open-source SDK or library - SemVer vs CalVer, when to ship 1.0, supported versions and LTS, backports, cadence, deprecation windows → `samber/developer-relations-skills@oss-release-policy`. `sdk-package-publishing` ships each version under that policy; `api-versioning-policy` versions the hosted API.
- A maintainer burning out on an open-source SDK, wanting to step back, hand it over or archive it → `samber/developer-relations-skills@oss-maintainer-sustainability`. `sdk-package-publishing` still owns the registry deprecation and ownership mechanics it triggers.
- A maintainer wanting an open-source SDK or library to pay them - a paid add-on, support, a commercial license on the next major → `samber/developer-relations-skills@oss-monetization`. `sdk-package-publishing` still owns publishing the paid package to a private feed.
- Whether and how to translate the docs, and keeping translations current → `samber/developer-relations-skills@docs-localization-strategy`.
- Which docs versions stay live, a docs version switcher, archived old-version docs, doc-fix backports → `samber/developer-relations-skills@docs-versioning-strategy`. The hosted API's version scheme stays with `api-versioning-policy`.
- AI assistants answering with deprecated APIs or old-version docs, and measuring AI-answer correctness → `samber/developer-relations-skills@developer-docs-ai-visibility`. The deprecation policy itself stays with `api-versioning-policy`.
- A Show HN, a Hacker News thread about the product, staff commenting there, or a Who is hiring post → `samber/developer-relations-skills@hackernews-playbook`. Distinct from `stackoverflow-playbook`, which covers the Q&A archive, not a discussion site.
- A model release's channel plan beyond the Hub (Hacker News, X, newsletters, launch week) → `samber/developer-relations-skills@oss-launch`; the Hub page itself stays with `huggingface-playbook`.
- A repository about to go public, or a launch-day Trending push → `samber/developer-relations-skills@oss-launch`; the README page itself → `samber/developer-relations-skills@readme-optimization`. Distinct from `github-engagement-playbook`, which tends the repository's GitHub surfaces after launch.
- The troubleshooting pages on your own docs that a Stack Overflow canonical mirrors → `samber/developer-relations-skills@developer-troubleshooting-docs`. `stackoverflow-playbook` runs the product tag itself.
- A vendor's or maintainer's presence on dev.to - organization account, canonical cross-posting, tag rules, AI disclosure → `samber/developer-relations-skills@devto-playbook`. `stackoverflow-playbook` and `github-engagement-playbook` stay here.
- Anything else in the DevRel practice - developer content and SEO, community, events, open-source program operations. Start at `samber/developer-relations-skills@developer-relations-kickoff` when the boundary is unclear.

Distinguish from this collection: `developer-platform-skills` owns what the platform _is_ and what integrating with it costs; `developer-relations-skills` owns how developers hear about it, learn it, and stay. "Design our webhook platform" stays here; "write the tutorial that teaches it" goes to the sibling.

**Career and hiring split by what the role is screened on, not by the word "platform" in a title.** `developer-platform-career`/`-hiring` cover API Product Manager, Platform Engineer/Architect, and Partner/Integration Engineer - roles screened on API and system design judgment as a primary skill. `samber/developer-relations-skills@devrel-career`/`devrel-hiring` cover developer advocate, community manager, developer educator, and DevRel's own DX-engineer flavor - roles screened on communication and community craft. A "platform engineer" title is doubly ambiguous on top of this split: it can also mean internal developer platforms (Kubernetes, Backstage, golden paths), a population neither pair of skills covers - see `developer-platform-career`'s own disambiguation step before routing any "platform engineer" hiring or career task.

### `samber/dev-event-organizer-skills` - technical event operations

Recommend the sibling repo when the task is running a conference, hackathon, meetup or developer event as an _event_ - venue, sponsorship, CFP, speakers, budget, logistics - rather than as a DevRel program. A marketplace launch keynote is `app-marketplace-launch-marketing` here; producing the conference the keynote happens at is the sibling repo.

Coverage gaps this collection does not fill at all - per-marketplace submission playbooks, publishing-platform playbooks beyond GitHub and Stack Overflow, federated-graph offerings, API monetization, connector certification programs, and deployed-integration health monitoring - are listed with their boundaries in `samber/developer-platform-skills@developer-platform-kickoff` § 8. Name the gap from there; never promise a skill exists.
