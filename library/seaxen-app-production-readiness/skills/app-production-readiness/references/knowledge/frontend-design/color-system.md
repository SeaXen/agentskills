### Color Relationships

| Scheme | How to Create | When to Use |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Monochromatic** | Pick ONE hue, vary only lightness/saturation | Minimal, professional, cohesive |
| **Analogous** | Pick 2-3 ADJACENT hues on wheel | Harmonious, calm, nature-inspired |
| **Complementary** | Pick OPPOSITE hues on wheel | High contrast, vibrant, attention |
| **Split-Complementary** | Base + 2 colors adjacent to complement | Dynamic but balanced |
| **Triadic** | 3 hues EQUIDISTANT on wheel | Vibrant, playful, creative |

### How to Choose a Scheme:
1. **What's the project mood?** Calm â†’ Analogous. Bold â†’ Complementary.
2. **How many colors needed?** Minimal â†’ Monochromatic. Complex â†’ Triadic.
3. **Who's the audience?** Conservative â†’ Monochromatic. Young â†’ Triadic.

```

### Implementation Pattern
```css
:root {
  /* 60% - Pick based on light/dark mode and mood */
  --color-bg: /* neutral: white, off-white, or dark gray */
  --color-surface: /* slightly different from bg */
  
  /* 30% - Pick based on brand or context */
  --color-secondary: /* muted version of primary or neutral */
  
  /* 10% - Pick based on desired action/emotion */
  --color-accent: /* vibrant, attention-grabbing */
}
```

## 3. Color Psychology - Meaning & Selection

### How to Choose Based on Context

| If Project Is... | Consider These Hues | Why |
|------------------|---------------------|-----|
| **Finance, Tech, Healthcare** | Blues, Teals | Trust, stability, calm |
| **Eco, Wellness, Nature** | Greens, Earth tones | Growth, health, organic |
| **Food, Energy, Youth** | Orange, Yellow, Warm | Appetite, excitement, warmth |
| **Luxury, Beauty, Creative** | Deep Teal, Gold, Black | Sophistication, premium |
| **Urgency, Sales, Alerts** | Red, Orange | Action, attention, passion |

### Emotional Associations (For Decision Making)

| Hue Family | Positive Associations | Cautions |
|------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Blue** | Trust, calm, professional | Can feel cold, corporate |
| **Green** | Growth, nature, success | Can feel boring if overused |
| **Red** | Passion, urgency, energy | High arousal, use sparingly |
| **Orange** | Warmth, friendly, creative | Can feel cheap if saturated |
| **Purple** | âš ï¸ **BANNED** - AI overuses this! | Use Deep Teal/Maroon/Emerald instead |
| **Yellow** | Optimism, attention, happy | Hard to read, use as accent |
| **Black** | Elegance, power, modern | Can feel heavy |
| **White** | Clean, minimal, open | Can feel sterile |

### Selection Process:
1. **What industry?** â†’ Narrow to 2-3 hue families
2. **What emotion?** â†’ Pick primary hue
3. **What contrast?** â†’ Decide light vs dark mode
4. **ASK USER** â†’ Confirm before proceeding

## 4. Palette Generation Principles

### From a Single Color (HSL Method)

Instead of memorizing hex codes, learn to **manipulate HSL**:

```
HSL = Hue, Saturation, Lightness

Hue (0-360): The color family
  0/360 = Red
  60 = Yellow
  120 = Green
  180 = Cyan
  240 = Blue
  300 = Purple

Saturation (0-100%): Color intensity
  Low = Muted, sophisticated
  High = Vibrant, energetic

Lightness (0-100%): Brightness
  0% = Black
  50% = Pure color
  100% = White
```

### Generating a Full Palette

Given ANY base color, create a scale:

```
Lightness Scale:
  50  (lightest) â†’ L: 97%
  100            â†’ L: 94%
  200            â†’ L: 86%
  300            â†’ L: 74%
  400            â†’ L: 66%
  500 (base)     â†’ L: 50-60%
  600            â†’ L: 48%
  700            â†’ L: 38%
  800            â†’ L: 30%
  900 (darkest)  â†’ L: 20%
```

### Saturation Adjustments

| Context | Saturation Level |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Professional/Corporate** | Lower (40-60%) |
| **Playful/Youth** | Higher (70-90%) |
| **Dark Mode** | Reduce by 10-20% |
| **Accessibility** | Ensure contrast, may need adjustment |

---

## 5. Context-Based Selection Guide

### Instead of Copying Palettes, Follow This Process:

**Step 1: Identify the Context**
```
What type of project?
â”œâ”€â”€ E-commerce â†’ Need trust + urgency balance
â”œâ”€â”€ SaaS/Dashboard â†’ Need low-fatigue, data focus
â”œâ”€â”€ Health/Wellness â†’ Need calming, natural feel
â”œâ”€â”€ Luxury/Premium â†’ Need understated elegance
â”œâ”€â”€ Creative/Portfolio â†’ Need personality, memorable
â””â”€â”€ Other â†’ ASK the user
```

**Step 2: Select Primary Hue Family**
```
Based on context, pick ONE:
- Blue family (trust)
- Green family (growth)
- Warm family (energy)
- Neutral family (elegant)
- OR ask user preference
```

**Step 3: Decide Light/Dark Mode**
```
Consider:
- User preference?
- Industry standard?
- Content type? (text-heavy = light preferred)
- Time of use? (evening app = dark option)
```

**Step 4: Generate Palette Using Principles**
- Use HSL manipulation
- Follow 60-30-10 rule
- Check contrast (WCAG)
- Test with actual content

## 6. Dark Mode Principles

### Key Rules (No Fixed Codes)

1. **Never pure black** â†’ Use very dark gray with slight hue
2. **Never pure white text** â†’ Use 87-92% lightness
3. **Reduce saturation** â†’ Vibrant colors strain eyes in dark mode
4. **Elevation = brightness** â†’ Higher elements slightly lighter

### Contrast in Dark Mode

```
Background layers (darker â†’ lighter as elevation increases):
Layer 0 (base)    â†’ Darkest
Layer 1 (cards)   â†’ Slightly lighter
Layer 2 (modals)  â†’ Even lighter
Layer 3 (popups)  â†’ Lightest dark
```

### Adapting Colors for Dark Mode

| Light Mode | Dark Mode Adjustment |
|------------|---------------------|
| High saturation accent | Reduce saturation 10-20% |
| Pure white background | Dark gray with brand hue tint |
| Black text | Light gray (not pure white) |
| Colorful backgrounds | Desaturated, darker versions |

---

## 7. Accessibility Guidelines

### Contrast Requirements (WCAG)

| Level | Normal Text | Large Text |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| AA (minimum) | 4.5:1 | 3:1 |
| AAA (enhanced) | 7:1 | 4.5:1 |

### How to Check Contrast

1. **Convert colors to luminance**
2. **Calculate ratio**: (lighter + 0.05) / (darker + 0.05)
3. **Adjust until ratio meets requirement**

### Safe Patterns

| Use Case | Guideline |
|----------|-----------|
| **Text on light bg** | Use lightness 35% or less |
| **Text on dark bg** | Use lightness 85% or more |
| **Primary on white** | Ensure dark enough variant |
| **Buttons** | High contrast between bg and text |

## 8. Color Selection Checklist

Before finalizing any color choice, verify:

- [ ] **Asked user preference?** (if not specified)
- [ ] **Matches project context?** (industry, audience)
- [ ] **Follows 60-30-10?** (proper distribution)
- [ ] **WCAG compliant?** (contrast checked)
- [ ] **Works in both modes?** (if dark mode needed)
- [ ] **NOT your default/favorite?** (variety check)
- [ ] **Different from last project?** (avoid repetition)

---

## 9. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### âŒ DON'T:
- Copy the same hex codes every project
- Default to purple/violet (AI tendency)
- Default to dark mode + neon (AI tendency)
- Use pure black (#000000) backgrounds
- Use pure white (#FFFFFF) text on dark
- Ignore user's industry context
- Skip asking user preference

### âœ… DO:
- Generate fresh palette per project
- Ask user about color preferences
- Consider industry and audience
- Use HSL for flexible manipulation
- Test contrast and accessibility
- Offer light AND dark options

---

> **Remember**: Colors are decisions, not defaults. Every project deserves thoughtful selection based on its unique context.
