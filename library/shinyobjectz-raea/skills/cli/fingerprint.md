A fingerprint is one person's sense of good work, kept in `~/.raea/fingerprints/NAME`. It is a list of axes (blur,
flash, clipping, pace, a brand's colours) with a small head for each over encoders that run on this Mac: SigLIP for
pictures, CLAP for sound, YAMNet for sound events and EmbeddingGemma 2 for scripts and other text; each axis judges
only what a file has. A new axis judges from its words until it has been trained;
`bootstrap` trains the mechanical axes by damaging moments of your own renders, and `teach` adds a label at a moment
you point at. A person can keep several, each saying what it's for, and one can build on another with `--extends`.
The app's Fingerprint page shows the same thing: what each one knows, what it's still learning, and what it can't
judge yet. `postmortem` looks back on a finished project with at most ten questions, and `things` says where a
thing floats or passes through another, the camera lurches or the frame is empty, for `raea check --things`. See
[docs/fingerprint.md](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/docs/fingerprint.md) for the plan.

## Usage

```sh
raea fingerprint new NAME [--who W] [--about TEXT] [--extends FP] [--kinds K,K] [--tags T,T] | raea fingerprint bootstrap FILE...

```

Headless: it needs nothing running and opens no window. Takes any number of arguments besides its flags.

## Flags

| Flag | Takes | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--about` | `TEXT` | What this fingerprint is for, in a sentence, shown beside its name in the app |
| `--against` | `LIST` | With profile: a file listing unrelated work, one path a line, that the references must fit their own ranges better than |
| `--as` | `NAME` | With profile: the name the profile is kept under, for score --profile |
| `--ask` | `N` | With readings: put N of the readings to you in the app, one question each, to check before notes train; with postmortem: ask at most N (10 at most) |
| `--at` | `T` | The moment a label is for, in seconds |
| `--axis` | `A` | The axis a label is for, by name, such as blur or clip |
| `--bad` | – | The moment has the problem the axis names (the default) |
| `--box` | `x0,y0,x1,y1` | Where in the frame the label is, as fractions of the width and height |
| `--by` | `kimi\|claude` | With read: which fresh session reads your notes, kimi (the default) or claude |
| `--extends` | `FP` | Another of your fingerprints to start from: the new one takes its axes and adds its own |
| `--fp` | `CHILD` | Which fingerprint to use, by name; without it, the default |
| `--from` | `LIST` | A file listing the renders to learn from, one path a line, relative to the file; lines starting with # are skipped |
| `--good` | – | The moment is fine on that axis |
| `--in` | `project\|workspace` | With use or share: the level the fingerprint is pinned or copied to, the project's or the workspace's folder |
| `--json` | – | Print the result as JSON |
| `--kinds` | `K,K` | With new: the kinds of piece it judges (film, ad, game, playable, still, sound), comma-separated |
| `--per` | `N` | How many moments to take from each render (10 if not given) |
| `--profile` | `NAME` | With score: also say which measures fall outside this profile's ranges, where, and which way to move |
| `--project` | `P` | The project the label came from, so evidence is held out by project; with move, only that project's labels |
| `--sheet` | `out.png` | Also write a contact sheet PNG of the moments it expects a note on |
| `--source` | `S` | With move: only labels from this source (note, teach, approval, pair, damage) |
| `--span` | `S` | How long the labelled moment lasts, in seconds |
| `--tags` | `T,T` | With new: the project tags it judges, comma-separated; a project picks the one matching its kind and tags best |
| `--tally` | – | With readings: count your answers so far against the readings asked, and say whether notes have earned training; with postmortem: make your answers evidence and say how each head moved |
| `--then` | `T2` | With pair: the moment in BETTER, when it isn't at the same time as --at in WORSE |
| `--timeline` | – | Describe the piece second by second in words |
| `--to` | `PARENT` | With move: the fingerprint the labels move up to, one this one extends (its nearest by default) |
| `--was` | `OLD` | With score: whether each of the earlier cut's gating flags is fixed, still there, or looks disguised (nearer the axis's disguised defects than clean work); exits 1 unless all are fixed |
| `--who` | `W` | Whose fingerprint it is, shown on its card |
| `--words` | `W` | The label's own words, as the note said them |
