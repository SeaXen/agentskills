`raea` is one program with a verb for each job. Each verb has a page here with its forms, where it runs, every flag
it takes and what each one does. The forms and flags are generated from the binary itself (`raea help --json`), so
they match the version they were made from; the prose around them is written by hand.

## How every verb behaves

- **Help.** `raea help` (or `raea` alone) lists every verb's forms. `raea help --json` gives the same as data: each
  verb's forms, its flags, how many values each flag takes, how many arguments it takes and where it runs.
- **Strict arguments.** A verb refuses a flag or an argument its forms don't name, rather than ignoring it, so a
  typo is caught. The four verbs with parsers of their own (`media`, `gen`, `physics`, `blender`) list their own forms.
- **Output.** A verb prints its result on stdout and exits 0. When it can't do what it was asked, it prints a line
  starting with `REFUSED` that says why and what to do instead, and exits 1. A file refused again is told what
  changed since the last refusal.
- **Where it runs.** Almost every verb is headless: it needs nothing running and opens no window, so it works over
  SSH, in CI and from an agent. `raea library` needs the raea app running, and adding a folder waits for a person's
  yes in the app.
- **Sessions.** Each `render` and `play` records its session; [`raea traces`](traces.md) lists them.
- **Version.** `raea --version` prints the version. The agent skill and these pages match it.

## Check

What's wrong before anyone watches it.

| [`raea solid`](solid.md) | Measure, view and export a solid: parts built from code with exact volumes, joints and parameters. |
| [`raea next`](next.md) | The two or three most useful next steps for a project, read from its brief, compositions, renders and checks. |
| [`raea doctor`](doctor.md) | Find what doesn't match this version of raea: old brief files, an older workspace format, an agent's stale skill. |
