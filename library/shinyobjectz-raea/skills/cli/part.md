`raea part` is the old name of [`raea component`](component.md), and still works the same. `raea part list` shows
the ready-made components; `raea part add` copies one into `components/NAME/`, where it's yours: raea never updates
or overwrites it unasked.

```sh
raea part list
raea part add captions end-card
```

<!-- generated:begin by tools/manual-ref/cli.ts from `raea help --json`; edit only the flag descriptions -->

## Usage

```sh
raea component list | raea component add NAME ... [--shared] [--force] | raea part list | raea part add NAME ... [--shared] [--force]   (a ready component or set copied into components/, or the workspace's shared/components/ with --shared, yours to change; raea part is its old name)
```

Headless: it needs nothing running and opens no window. Takes any number of arguments besides its flags.

## Flags

| Flag | Takes | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--force` | – | Replace a part's files that are already in `components/`. Without it, an existing part is left alone and the command stops. |
| `--shared` | – | Copy into the workspace's `shared/components/` instead, where every project in the workspace imports it as `/components/NAME`. |
